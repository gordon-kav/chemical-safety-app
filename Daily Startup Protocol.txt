Go to the App's backend folder in Git Bash

"C:\Users\Gordon\chemical-safety-app\backend\app"

Type : cd /c/Users/Gordon/chemical-safety-app/backend/app

Now get the Uvicorn server running

uvicorn main:app --reload


🟢 Chemical Safety App: Daily Startup Protocol
1. Open the Terminal
Right-click on your Desktop (or wherever you want) and select Git Bash Here.

Alternatively: Open "Git Bash" from the Start Menu.

2. Navigate to the Project
Copy and paste this command to go straight to your backend folder (no matter where you started):

Bash
cd /c/Users/Gordon/chemical-safety-app/backend
3. Activate the "Tool Belt" (Virtual Environment)
This is the most critical step. You must tell the terminal to use your project's specific tools.

Bash
source venv/Scripts/activate
✅ Check: Look at the start of your command line. It must say (venv) in parentheses. If it doesn't, stop and try this step again.

4. Start the Server (The Engine)
Run the application server:

Bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
✅ Success Signal: You will see text saying Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000.

5. Verify it is working
Leave the terminal window open (do not close it!). Open your web browser (Chrome/Edge) and go to:

http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs

If you see the FastAPI / Swagger UI page, you are live.

6. How to Stop
When you are finished working for the day:

Click inside the terminal window.

Press Ctrl + C on your keyboard (this kills the server).

Type exit or close the window.
